# HR-Report

## Project Overview:
This project utilizes SQL to extract and analyze HR data, uncovering valuable insights and answering key business questions. The findings are then visualized using Power Bi, creating interactive dashboards that showcase HR metrics and insights that provides a comprehensive understanding of the company's HR landscape

### Data sources:
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HRData.csv" dataset

### Tools Used:
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Github for version control and collaboration

### Data Cleaning/Preparation:
In the initial data preparation we perform the following task:
- Data loading and inspection into Ms SQL
- Data cleaning: Standardize date column and update 'race' column
- Enrich data with new column 'Age' and 'Termination_date '

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Apply statistical and visual methods to understand data distribution, relationships and patterns,leading us to answer key questions such as:
- What is the age group distribution in the company?
- What is the age group distribution by Gender in the company?
- What is the gender breakdown in the company
- How gender varies with job tittle
- How Gender Varies with Departments
- What is the race breakdown in the company?
- What is the Average rate of Employment in the Company?

- How many people work remotely compared to those working at the headquarters?
- What's The Distribution Of Workers Across Different States?
- How are Jobtitles Distributed In The Company?
- How have Employee Hire Counts Varied over time?

### SQL Skills Used:
- SELECT statements with filters and sorting
- Group by used for Aggregations
- UPDATE, DELETE and CASE statements for data cleaning
- CTEs used for simplyfying complex queries and for data transformation
- Views for later visualization

### Deliverables:
- SQL Script for Exploratory Data Analysis
- Interactive dashboards for employee demographics, turnover rate etc
- Visualization for employee recruitment and termination 
- GitHub repository with code and documentation
